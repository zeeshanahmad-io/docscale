## 1. Optimize Your Google Business Profile

Your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is your digital front door. It's the most important factor for local SEO.
* **Complete Your Profile**: Ensure your name, address, and phone number (NAP) are accurate and consistent with your website.
* **Choose the Right Categories**: Don't just select "Doctor." Be specific (e.g., "Dermatology Clinic" or "Pediatrician").
* **Get Reviews**: Encourage happy patients to leave reviews on your profile. Responding to both positive and negative feedback professionally is crucial for building trust.

## 2. Focus on Local Keywords

Patients in India often search for doctors "near me" or in their specific city. Your website content should reflect this.
* **Targeted Keywords**: Use keywords like "cardiologist in Patna" or "best dentist near me in Bangalore" in your website content, especially in your page titles and headings.
* **Create Location-Specific Pages**: If your practice has multiple locations, create a separate page for each one, with unique content and local keywords.

## 3. Create High-Quality, Relevant Content

Content is the foundation of good SEO. By writing about health topics, you establish yourself as an expert and build trust with potential patients.
* **Patient-Focused Blog**: Write blog posts that answer common patient questions. For example, "What to expect during a dental check-up" or "Managing diabetes during Diwali."
* **Showcase Your Services**: Create a detailed service page for each treatment you offer, with clear descriptions and relevant keywords.

## 4. Ensure Your Website is Mobile-Friendly

Most of your potential patients will find your website on a mobile phone. A slow or difficult-to-use mobile site will cause them to leave instantly.
* **Fast Loading Time**: Optimize images and code to ensure your website loads in under 3 seconds.
* **Easy Navigation**: Make sure your "Book an Appointment" and "Call Now" buttons are easy to find and click on a mobile screen.

## 5. Build a Strong Online Reputation

Online reviews are now a major ranking factor for Google. A positive reputation not only boosts your SEO but also gives patients the confidence to choose your clinic.
* **Ask for Reviews**: Politely ask happy patients to leave you a review on Google and other platforms like Practo.
* **Manage Reviews**: Thank patients for positive reviews and professionally address any negative feedback. This shows you are responsive and care about patient experience.
