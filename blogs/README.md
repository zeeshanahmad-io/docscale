# Using Images in Markdown Blog Posts

- Store your images in `/public/images/blogs/`.
- Reference images in your Markdown like:

```markdown
![Alt text](../images/blogs/my-image.jpg)
```

- The `../` ensures the path works from the blog route.
- Always use descriptive alt text for SEO and accessibility.
