You are an expert in your field. You have successfully treated thousands of patients, handled complex cases, and your clinical outcomes are excellent. Yet, when you search for your specialty on Practo, a junior doctor with half your experience appears three spots above you.

Why? They have 250 reviews. You have 12.

In the Indian healthcare ecosystem, **Social Proof is the new currency.** Recent studies indicate that over **85% of urban Indian patients** consult online reviews before booking an appointment with a new doctor. On platforms like Practo, reviews are not just vanity metrics; they are the fuel for the **Practo ranking algorithm**.

However, asking for a review can feel awkward. It can feel "salesy" or beneath the dignity of the medical profession. Many doctors worry about violating NMC (National Medical Commission) ethics or appearing desperate.

At **[DocScale](/)**, we believe you shouldn't have to choose between your dignity and your digital reputation. You can build a stellar profile simply by operationalizing the feedback process. Here is how to **increase Practo reviews** ethically, effectively, and without feeling pushy (Updated for late 2025).

## 1. Timing is Everything: The "Peak-End" Rule

The biggest mistake doctors make is sending a generic feedback link via SMS 24 hours after the appointment. By then, the patient is back in their busy routine, stuck in traffic, or focused on work.

Psychologically, the best time to ask for feedback is the moment of "Relief"—usually immediately after the consultation when you have reassured them, or after a successful procedure.

**The Strategy:** Don't automate everything. A personal touch works best in India. If a patient verbally thanks you—*"Doctor, I feel so much better"* or *"Thank you for listening to me so patiently"*—that is your green light.

**What to say:** *"I am glad you are feeling better. That is always our goal. If you have a moment, sharing that experience on Practo helps other patients find the right care."*

It is subtle, helpful, and frames the review as a service to *other patients*, not a favor to *you*.

> **Pro Tip:** If you are uncomfortable asking personally, delegate. Your receptionist is your greatest asset in **[online reputation management for doctors](/#services)**. When the patient is at the desk settling the bill, the staff can say: *"How was your experience with the doctor? If you were happy, would you mind rating us?"*

## 2. The "QR Code" Strategy: Removing Friction

Indian patients are tech-savvy but impatient. If they have to open a browser, search for your name on Practo, log in, and then write a review, they won't do it. You need to reduce the effort to zero.

**The Strategy:** Place a small, professionally designed standee or placard at your reception desk with a **QR Code**. When scanned, this code should open your Practo feedback page directly.

**Where to place them:**

- **The Reception Desk:** While they wait for the bill or prescription printout.
- **The Pharmacy Counter:** If you have an attached pharmacy.
- **The Waiting Area:** A poster saying *"Help us improve your experience"* encourages feedback while they wait (though post-consultation is better for positive sentiment).

> **Quick Win:** Go to a free QR code generator site. Paste your direct Practo Profile link. Print the QR code with the text: *"Happy with your consultation? Scan to let us know in 10 seconds."*

## 3. Patient Feedback Scripts: What to Say (and What Not To)

Ambiguity kills action. If you just say "Review us," patients don't know what to write. They might write "Good doctor," which is fine, but detailed reviews help your SEO more.

You need **patient feedback scripts** that guide them gently.

**For WhatsApp Follow-ups (Post-Consultation):** Instead of a dry automated message, try a warmer approach: *"Dear [Patient Name], we hope you are recovering well. Dr. [Name] values your trust. If our treatment helped you, could you spare 30 seconds to rate us on Practo? It helps us serve you better. [Link]"*

**The "Service" Angle:** Frame the request around improving the clinic. *"We are trying to digitize our clinic to help more patients in [City Name]. Your feedback on Practo helps the algorithm show us to patients in need. Would you mind helping us out?"*

> **Pro Tip:** Never offer discounts, free consultations, or medicines in exchange for a review. This strictly violates Practo’s terms and medical ethics. The review must be voluntary and genuine.

## 4. Handling Negatives: Turning 1-Star into Trust

Nothing stings more than a 1-star review, especially if it feels unfair (e.g., complaining about parking or wait time rather than treatment). However, in **[online reputation management](/#services)**, a negative review is an opportunity.

Prospective patients *read* the negative reviews to see how you react. If you react with anger or defensiveness, you lose them. If you react with grace, you win their trust.

**How to Reply:**

1. **Acknowledge and Apologize:** Even if it wasn't your fault.
1. **Take it Offline:** Do not argue details in public.
1. **Maintain Privacy:** Never reveal patient medical details to prove them wrong.

**Example Script:** *"Dear [Name], we are sorry to hear you had a long wait time. We try our best to give every patient adequate time, which sometimes causes delays. We value your feedback and are working to improve our scheduling. Please contact our clinic manager at [Phone Number] so we can address this directly."*

This shows you care, you are professional, and you are open to improvement.

> **Quick Win:** Set up a Google Alert for your name and clinic name. You need to know the moment a review is posted so you can respond promptly. Unaddressed negative reviews fester like untreated wounds.

## 5. Understanding the Practo Ranking Algorithm

Why do some doctors rank higher? It isn't just the sheer number of reviews. Practo (like Google) cares about **Relevance and Recency**.

1. **Recency:** 10 reviews from last month are better than 50 reviews from 2021. You need a steady trickle of feedback, not a one-time flood.
1. **Length & Keywords:** A review that says *"Dr. Sharma explained the root canal procedure perfectly and the cost was affordable"* is more valuable than one that says *"Nice doctor."* The text contains keywords (Root Canal, Cost, Affordable) that the algorithm picks up.
1. **The "Verified Patient" Tag:** Practo places immense weight on reviews from patients who booked *via* Practo or Practo Ray software. These are marked as "Verified" and boost your ranking significantly more than unverified user submissions.

**The Strategy:** Encourage patients who booked via the Practo app to use the app's prompt to leave a review. It carries more weight.

## 6. Cross-Pollination: Practo as a Trust Signal

Your Practo reviews shouldn't live in a silo. They can help your overall SEO.

- **Website Widget:** Embed the "Practo Badge" on your clinic’s website homepage. It adds instant third-party credibility.
- **Social Media:** Create a template for "Patient Stories." If a patient writes a beautiful review on Practo, anonymize it (e.g., "A happy patient from Indiranagar says...") and post it on your Clinic’s Instagram or Facebook stories.

> **Pro Tip:** While Google Reviews are better for local SEO, Practo reviews are better for *specialist* authority. If you are a Super-Specialist (e.g., Neurosurgeon), prioritize Practo. If you are a General Physician or Dentist, prioritize Google Maps. Ideally, aim for a 60/40 split.

## Conclusion

You don't need to be a salesperson to get reviews. You just need to be a doctor who cares about the patient's entire journey—from the moment they walk in, to the moment they search for you online.

By implementing a simple QR code system, training your front desk, and responding with empathy, you can turn your happy patients into your strongest marketing channel. Remember, in digital healthcare, a 5-star rating isn't just a number; it's a digital referral.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I pay an agency to post fake positive reviews on Practo?** **A:** Absolutely not. Practo has a sophisticated fraud detection system. If you are caught using fake reviews, your profile can be blacklisted ("Practo Reach" suspension), which destroys your online presence. Furthermore, it is unethical and violates NMC guidelines.

**Q: How do I remove a fake negative review on Practo?** **A:** You cannot simply "delete" a review you dislike. However, if the review is genuinely fake, spam, or uses abusive language, you can report it to Practo Support via the "Report Abuse" button. You will need to provide evidence (e.g., proof that this person was never a patient) for them to investigate.

**Q: Should I ask every single patient for a review?** **A:** No. Use your judgment. Focus on patients who had a clearly positive outcome or expressed verbal gratitude. Avoid asking patients who received bad news or had a complicated administrative issue at the clinic.

**Q: Does replying to reviews actually help my ranking?** **A:** Yes. Engagement is a ranking signal. Responding to reviews shows the platform that the doctor is active and cares about patient feedback, which can positively influence your visibility in search results.
