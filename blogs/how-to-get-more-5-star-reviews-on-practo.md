The most effective way to get more reviews is to simply ask for them. After a successful consultation, have your staff send a polite and simple message to the patient.

- **Automate the Request**: Use an automated SMS or WhatsApp message that goes out a few hours after the patient's appointment.
- **Provide a Direct Link**: Make it as easy as possible. Include a direct link to your Practo profile's review section. The less friction, the more likely the patient is to leave a review.

A complete and professional profile instills confidence in patients and encourages them to leave positive feedback.

- **Add Professional Photos**: A professional headshot and clear photos of your clinic build trust and professionalism.
- **Engage with the Platform**: Share health tips and updates on your Practo profile to show you're an active and engaging practitioner.

## 3. Manage Your Reviews Professionally

What you do after a review is just as important as getting the review itself.

- **Respond to All Reviews**: Thank patients for positive reviews and acknowledge any negative feedback with a professional and empathetic response.
- **Move Negative Conversations Offline**: If a patient leaves a negative review, respond publicly by offering to resolve the issue privately. This shows you care and are taking action without violating patient confidentiality.
- **Stay Professional**: Never argue with a patient online. A calm and professional response can often turn a negative review into a positive brand moment.
